Pia is a physicist with more than ten years of experience in scientific
programming and data analysis. She holds a PhD in physics, which she obtained
from the University of Freiburg, Germany in 2010. She has been working as a
researcher, mentor and lecturer in astrophysics at different research
institutions across Europe before she joined Expert Analytics in 2018.
Her areas of expertise include numerical simulations of complex physical systems,
statistical data analysis and signal processing, as well machine learning applications
and visualization and handling of large datasets.

Her analytical mindset and a solid background in physics provide her with a
solid foundation for finding solutions to complex problems. She is interested
in new challenges, with the goal of applying sophisticated physics and math concepts
to develop real world solutions for big data.

Since 2018, she has been working as senior data scientist in the renewable energy sector
in Norway. In this position, she is responsible for the development and implementation of
scalable machine learning solutions for predictive maintenance and production optimization
of hydropower plants and wind parks.
