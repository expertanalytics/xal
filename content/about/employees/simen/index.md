Simen is a computational scientist who finished his Ph.D. in computational
neuroscience in 2019.  He has a background from computational astrophysics
where he wrote software for finding clusters of galaxies in cosmological N-body
simulations.  His Ph.D. focused on quantifying uncertainties in computational
models of neurons and neural networks and he created a Python toolbox for
performing these calculations.

Additionally, the work included creating a new specification for data storage,
data analysis, and developing an educational neural network simulator.  Simen
also has teaching experience and has co-authored a textbook that teaches
first-semester bachelor students in biology programming, data analysis, and
computational modeling.

Simen has experience at learning new disciplines and enjoys using the computer
to solve complex problems, create models and numerical simulations and perform
data analysis.
