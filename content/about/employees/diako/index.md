Diako holds a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from the University of Oslo. As
a student at both Mathematics and Physics departments at the University of Oslo, 
he has acquired a broad knowledge in various physical and mathematical theories, 
and numerical methods. 

<!--more-->

During his Ph.D. period he has been involved in several projects within
multiple research groups at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. He
has developed high performance numerical codes, in C/C++ and Python/Cython
combining various numerical methods, to study plasma-object interactions and
ionospheric instabilities and turbulence. In addition, he has developed new
analytical models describing the interactions between electrically conducting
objects and plasmas.

Through his education, Diako has developed strong analytical and numerical skills 
to solve complex problems related to phenomena arising in the natural world.
