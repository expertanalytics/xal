Alexander submitted his master's thesis in computational quantum physics at
the University of Oslo in 2018. 
For the past two years, he has worked on projects in the public 
transport sector for [Ruter As](https://www.ruter.no). Here he has developed
software using various technologies including Python, Flask, Google OR-Tools,
Javascript/React.js, Git, Jenkins and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The subject of Alexander's thesis was Monte Carlo simulations of quantum dots
using C++ and Python.  
His education trained him in solving complex physical and 
mathematical problems using various numerical methods and libraries
as well as visualizing the results. 
These experiences have made him a seasoned programmer. 
He is also a fast learner and can adapt to new frameworks and
programming languages quickly.
In addition to the aforementioned programming languages, he has experience
with Java and C.
