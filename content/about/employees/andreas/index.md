Andreas submitted his master’s thesis in applied mathematics from the University of Oslo and Simula Research Laboratory. In his thesis he investigated numerical schemes, for solving equations describing Fluid-Structure Interaction, using Python and FEniCS. His academic background has given him several tools and approaches for solving complex problems in a computational/software domain.


During his stay at Expert Analytics, he has been polishing his Python skills, while diving into C++ and Arduino technologies in his spare time. Andreas is a positive and curious individual, always interested in learning new concepts and technologies.
