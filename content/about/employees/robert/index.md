Robert Solli is a specialist in scientific programming, with expertise in
mathematical optimisation, statistical analysis and machine learning. He has
solved a varied set of problems with this skillset, from understanding complex
physical systems to increasing student volunteer participation.

Robert submitted his master's degree in Computational Physics in 2019. In the
thesis, Robert analysed events in a nuclear physics experiment to separate
reaction products using machine learning techniques. He completed the degree at
the University of Oslo where he also worked as a research assistant.  In his
work as a research assistant, he analysed and wrote a paper on understanding
student interactions with an online video course. 

Robert is also an avid climber and takes as much delight in finding solutions
to hard problems on a sheer rock-face as to those presented by data.
