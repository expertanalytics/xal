Using libraries is an integral part of using Python properly. As a
collection of tools grows, it will at some point make sense to make
your own Python libraries.

## Course Content

In this course we will introduce code deployment in Python. In
addition, some best practices advice will be discussed to let the code
reflect the deployment.

## Prerequisite

This course requires some familiarity with the Python programming
language, introduced [here](/training/python/introduction/).

## Duration: 1 hour

## Tools Introduced

Distutils
: The Distutils package provides support for building and installing
  additional modules into a Python installation. The new modules may
  either be 100% pure Python, extension modules written in C, or
  collections of Python packages which include modules coded in both
  Python and C.
