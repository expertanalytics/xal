Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the
ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is the study
and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make
predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from
example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions,
rather than following strictly static program instructions. The term
"machine learning" is an umbrella term and can be used to describe one
of the following topics:

- **Classification:** Identifying categories an object belongs to.
- **Regression:** Predict values associated with objects.
- **Clustering:** Automatically group similar objects into sets.
- **Dimension reduction:** Make large scale problems more manageable.
- **Model selection:** Find and calibrate the best models.
- **Preprocessing:** Normalizing of raw data preparing it for learning algorithms.

## Course Content

In this course we will focus on the application of tools to perform
various aspects of machine learning, using the Dlib library. We will
touch base on how the various algorithms work.

## Prerequisite

The course requires familiarity with C++ programming language.

## Duration: 4-6 hours

## Tools Introduced

Dlib
: Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms
  and tools for creating complex software in C++. The software is open
  source and cross platform compatible, and also features more general
  purpose functionality e.g. linear algebra, image processing, GUI
  etc. The library supports a number of machine learning algorithms,
  such as Support Vector Machines and neural networks.
