In today's world of everything distributed, making a system do
the right thing is not always an easy task. In addition, requirements constantly evolve and business owners often like to use the newest and shiniest advancements. Developing software systems in a maintainable manner with focus on correctness becomes then a challenge. And we are up for that challenge - our software engineers usually consider the case more interesting, the more complex it gets.

Consultants at Expert Analytics have participated in large system development projects
with many of our clients, and often take on roles as tech lead, lead
developer or technical architect. And we are eager at keeping up with modern
trends such as variants of agile development, test-driven development, and
DevSecOps. A narrow view on the programming environment is not sufficient, but rather a holistic view that includes databases, run time and testing environments, continous integration and deployment in addition to the
development environment itself.

When it comes to the actual tools to be used in a project, we try to be
pretty agnostic. The preferences and competences of the client are usually the
deciding factors when several tools can do the job. We are fine with that - and will adapt - as through the years we have come to understand that a tool often just decides the syntax. We contribute with a deeper
understanding and the ability to solve the problems at hand - solutions can
then be coded up in the selected environment. There are however situations where
we understand that a tool is very wrong for the problem to be solved, and then
we will speak out.

To get the full scope of the languages, tools, and environments that Expert
Analytics can apply to your project, the individual CVs of our employees can be consulted. What we most often use is Python, Java, Go, and C++. We have worked extensively with Postgres, Azure SQL, Google Datastore and Firestore, and Cosmos DB. For continuous testing and integration we are familiar with most of the main
players, and we have deployed on Google, Azure, and Amazon cloud solutions.
