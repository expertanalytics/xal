Since 2013, we have been involved in projects with Norwegian companies building
mobile payment systems; mCash, Auka, and Vipps. Our involvement have mostly
been on the backend, working on core transaction and settlement logic as well
as internal and external APIs.

When working on payment systems, the concepts of data consistency, idempotent
operations, and fault-tolerant operations need to be well understood. In order
for the system to perform well under load, it is required to understand the
relevant performance characteristics of the system including e.g. modern cloud
infrastructures.

Through the years, we have built domain knowledge within the field of mobile
payments that we now can apply with existing and new customers working on
problems in the financial sector. The technologies we have applied in this
field are mainly Python and Go, deployed on the Google App Engine and Azure
stacks. Both relational and document database models have been used.
