A small bioinformatics software company is trying to disrupt in precision
cancer immunotherapy. They marked themselves using machine learning to predict
the effect of a therapy.

One of our consultants went in and took the role developing the backbone of the
scientific platform implementing state-of-the-art machine learning applied on
observational protein data scaling on the range of 10-20 GB. The algorithms
include support vector machine, random forest, artificial neural network, and
topic modeling. Some of these machine learning implementations are currently
(as of May 2018) marked leading within their applications.
