Ada is a data scientist at Expert Analytics with a background in academia. Her field of research is Solar Physics, and in addition to doing research she communicates science within education & outreach activities.\n\nThe article explains, in a plain language, the last stages in the Sun’s life: right now the Sun (and any other star in normal conditions) is in hydrostatic equilibrium, which means that the gravity force and the gas pressure compensate each other. The Sun is currently 4.6 billion years old, and it’s in a phase of its life called main sequence, in which stars burn hydrogen in their cores producing helium. Once it burns all the hydrogen in its core by nuclear fusion, the star won’t be in equilibrium anymore and it will shrink. This is the beginning of the end: the shrinking will heat the core to a temperature high enough to burn the next element, helium. At the same time the outer layers of the Sun will expand round 200 times its current diameter becoming a red giant (and maybe engulfing planet Earth). Again, equilibrium won’t be possible anymore once the core runs out of helium, the outer layers will be expelled into the interstellar medium (this beautiful remnants are called a planetary nebula) and the center will become a white dwarf, eventually fading and becoming dark. At that point the Sun won't be visible from anywhere, but for that we’ll have to wait another 5 billion years.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n![The Sun as seen by NASA's mission Solar Dynamics Observatory](swirling_plasma.jpg)\n\nCredit: \"Courtesy of NASA/SDO and the AIA, EVE, and HMI science teams.\"\n"},"Interview with Jonathan":{"title":"Interview with Jonathan","date":"2018-05-02T10:00:00.000Z","illustration":"illustrasjon_medium.jpg","body":"The University of Oslo recently interviewed Jonathan to learn how he\napplies the knowledge acquired during his studies in his current job\nas a senior consultant and problem solver in Expert Analytics.\n\nRead the article\n[here](https://www.uio.no/studier/program/matematikk-informatikk/karriereintervjuer/jonathan-feinberg.html)\n(written in Norwegian).\n\n<!--more-->\n\n![Jonathan](illustrasjon_medium.jpg)\n"},"Johannes talking at the Rust Meetup in Oslo":{"title":"Johannes talking at the Rust Meetup in Oslo","date":"2018-02-07T11:08:50.000Z","illustration":"photo.jpg","body":"The topic of the session was \"Barriers to Rust adoption in Norway\".
