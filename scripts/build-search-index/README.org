* Static search functionality

This is the code for building an index used for the static search. For documentation, see [[http://elasticlunr.com/][Elasticlunr]]'s home page. It is a "Lightweight full-text search engine in Javascript for browser search and offline search."

To build the index, run the following command *in the root directory*:
#+begin_src bash
./scripts/build-search-index/build-index.js > static/gen/index.json
#+end_src

This is done automatically during CI build.
